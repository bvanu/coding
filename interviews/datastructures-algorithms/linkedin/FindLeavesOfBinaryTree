Approach 1: DFS (Depth-First Search) without sorting
We've seen in approach 1 that there is an additional sorting that is being performed, which increases the overall time complexity to O(N \log N)O(NlogN). The question we can ask here is, can we do better than this? To answer this, we try to remove the sorting by directly placing all the values in their respective positions, i.e. instead of using the pairs array to collect all the (height, val) pairs and then sorting them based on their heights, we'll directly obtain the solution by placing each element (val) to its correct position in the solution array. To clarify, in the given binary tree, [4, 3, 5] goes into the first position, [2] goes into the second position and [1] goes into the third position in the solution array.

To do this, we modify our getHeight method to directly insert the node's value in the solution array at the correct location. Solution array is kept empty in the beginning and as we encounter elements with increasing height, we'll keep increasing the size of the solution array to accomodate for these elements. For example, if our solution array currently is [[4, 3, 5]] and if we want to insert 2 at the second position, we first create the space for 2 by increasing the size of the solution array by 1 and then insert 2 at it's correct location.

[[4, 3, 5]] -> [[4, 3, 5], []] # increase the size of solution array

[[4, 3, 5], []] -> [[4, 3, 5], [2]] # insert 2 at it's correct location

Below is the implementation of the above mentioned approach.

Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: Assuming NN is the total number of nodes in the binary tree, traversing the tree takes O(N)O(N) time and storing all the pairs at the correct position also takes O(N)O(N) time. Hence overall time complexity of this approach is O(N)O(N).
Space Complexity: O(N)O(N), the space used by solution array.

/*
Now everything is ready to write down an algorithm.

Initiate max_sum as the smallest possible integer and call max_gain(node = root).
Implement max_gain(node) with a check to continue the old path/to start a new path:
Base case : if node is null, the max gain is 0.
Call max_gain recursively for the node children to compute max gain from the left and right subtrees : left_gain = max(max_gain(node.left), 0) and
right_gain = max(max_gain(node.right), 0).
Now check to continue the old path or to start a new path. To start a new path would cost price_newpath = node.val + left_gain + right_gain. Update max_sum if it's better to start a new path.
For the recursion return the max gain the node and one/zero of its subtrees could add to the current path : node.val + max(left_gain, right_gain).

Complexity Analysis:
Time complexity : O(N) where N is number of nodes, since we visit each node not more than 2 times.
Space complexity : O(log(N)). We have to keep a recursion stack of the size of the tree height, which is O(log(N)) for the binary tree.

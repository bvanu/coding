5. (D1) Given an array which contains series of 0s and series of 1s, find the index where 1s start.
   How would you test this method?
   (D2) Assume input array has infinite length, how will you find the index in O(logn) time?
   D1: binary search O(logN)
   Testcases: null array, empty array, array with just one element - 0, array with just one element - 1.
   Array with only 0s. array with only 1s. 5 element array with 2 0s and 3 1s, array with numbers other then 0 and 1.
   D2: 2 step process: (i) Find the block in which transition from 0 to 1 happens. (ii)Then find the exact index within that block.
   For #i, consider first block with size K, if no transition in this block, then check next block with size 2K, then 4K, then 8K. Once we find the block with transition then step#ii is simple binary search.   

7. given an array of Strings , not necessarily in any order , find out if the string create a chain , such that first last char of a string is the first character of another and thus making a chain including at least all string

9. LRU Cache

10. Print binary tree in zigzag order (http://articles.leetcode.com/printing-binary-tree-in-zig-zag-level_18/)

11. Difference/explain all kinds of sorting

12. I have a number in mind. Can you tell your approach to find it? 

13. How do you split a string into meaning ful words? ex: icandoit -> i can do it

14. Find an element in rotated sorted array 

15. Find nth non repeating character in a stream 

16. Given a string. Suppose all its characters can be jumbled up and all possible strings are arranged in an alphabetical order. Now given a number n, find the nth word in the ordered list of words.

17. Make biggest Palindrome of the string. String contains on digits.String can have digits starting from 0.

18. Regular Expression.

19. Clone of linked list having random pointer. 

20. Topological sorting 

30. Dynamic programming, backtracking, matrix traversal, optimal sub-sequence, longest continuous path in a matrix

31. Written test, sort a million Person records according to their age.

32. F2F Algorithm for calender event scheduling, Algorithm for simple arithmetic expression…

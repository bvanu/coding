# Design questions

Grokking the system design interview:
https://www.educative.io/collection/5668639101419520/5649050225344512

1. How would you design a software system that controls a traffic signal? Draw the system on the white board.  

2. Design a system to count in a sliding window.

3. What would an API look like for the interactions between a plane and air traffic control.

4. OO design: Black Jack Game. 

5. System design: Amazon video subscription.

6. Design Amazon locker system

7. (A1) Design a single machine, single user system for hotel table reservations. Constraints: assume 16 tables with capacity 4, 16 tables with capacity 8. Can book for just 1 hr. Max 2 months in advance. Which classes, which data-stuctures? 
   (A2) What happens when a party of 16 requests for a table. You can join tables which are next to each other. Implement this.
   A1. Array of size 32. Each element in the array contains linkedList sorted by startTime where each link represents timeslot that is already booked/reserved.
   A2. Get a list of tables which are available in the requested time period, check if there is a contiguous set of tables which total up to 16 and then reserve those tables.

8. (B1) Design a deck of cards.
   (B2) Now assume 10 million users are using this card deck.
   B1. Deck class. Card class. Suit enum. Value Enum. Card contains Value and Suit enums. Deck contains an array of 52 cards. Constructor of Deck initializes 52 card class.
   Card should expose comparable interface.
   Deck should expose Shuffle and iterator interface.
   Some considerations: Should Deck be singleton? Should Deck be made generic to accept different types of cards? Should Desk be made threadsafe?
   B2. If there are 10 million users on the same machine using 10 million Decks, then we don't really need 520 million cards.
   Each Card instance is immutable. So we just need 52 card instances which are shared between 10 million Decks.

 9. Design distributed cache
 
10. How will you built a query service for all the stakeholders responsible for delivery of product.
 
11. How to handle server scaling up to sudden increased of request 
 
12. How to handle scaling the data

13. Design BookMyShow tables.

14. 2 . Given a party with n people , a given function Knows() , such that
	A knows B : true if a knows B
	A Celebrity would be a person who knows no one but is known by all
	Find out the celebrity if he exists in the party. I would like the mail id to be kept confidential.
